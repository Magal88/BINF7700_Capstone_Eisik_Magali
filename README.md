# Bioinformatics Capstone Project

This repository contains the final capstone project for the MSc in Bioinformatics at Northeastern University. 
The goal of this project is to share its content, including scripts (R Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks), datasets, and results, to provide a reproducible and well-documented analysis methodology.

## Technical Skills Inventory

**Computational & Analytical Skills**

**R**: R Notebooks (.Rmd).
**Python**: Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb).

**Statistics & Modeling**

**Descriptive statistics**
**Comparing group means: t-test, ANOVA.**
**Machine learning algorithms**

**Bioinformatics tools**

**Biological data analysis (Biopython, Bioconductor)**

**Visualization & Reporting**

**R**: ggplot2.
**Python**: matplotlib, seaborn.

## Learning Goals for the Course

**Gain greater experience in exploratory analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling of omics data.**
